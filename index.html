     <p>My name is Minal Kharche and I am currently training to become
        a full stack web developer. I am attending UC Berkeley bootcamp in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>On the personal side, I love travelling and photography. I often go to
        the National Parks
        and take pictures of trees, wild life and the surroundings. I am a morning person. I wake up
        early on the weekends and go on hikes and take pictures. I then create albums and share with
        my family and friends.</p>
